# Pandas-Data-Analysis
Various Python Pandas data analysis coursework. Three small Python Pandas data analysis projects.

1. Olympics and Census - basics of Pandas using Olympics country results data and US Census data
2. GDP, Energy, and Scientific Research by country. Demonstration of basics of using Python Pandas to cleanse datasets and merge datasets containing different types of data on the same set of countries.
3. GDP and Housing Price Data - University vs Non-University Towns. A more elaborate data analysis project. Tests the hypothesis that in the 2008-2009 Great Recession, US housing prices were significantly less affected (in terms of ratio between prices before recession and prices at lowest point of the recession) in university towns than in non-university towns. Tested one-sided hypothesis at p=0.01.
